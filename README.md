For my bachelor's thesis I created a 3D room interior visualisation with interactive elements using Babylon.js framework.

The purpose of this project is to create a website that would display the interior of the room with interactive elements and the information about them.

What can you do in this project:
  - Press on furniture and get information about them in pop-up window.
  - Change some textures and materials.
  - Rotate objects onclick.
  - Turn on and off light source.
  - Dragg objects and interact with physics.
